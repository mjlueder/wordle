# Wordle

A word-based game that tasks players with guessing a secret 5 letter word in 6 or fewer turns. Each guess tells you how close - or far - you are from the correct word.

Many people enjoy Wordle, but a common complaint is that it can only be played once a day. Now it can be played as often as desired, at any degree of difficulty!
